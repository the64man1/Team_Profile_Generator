## Description
    
I wanted to write a program that would allow a business owner to easily compile a webpage for displaying information about their work team


I wanted to build my skills in creating classes and handling the object data stored in classes


With this program, a user can use the command line to easily generate a team profile page


I learned how to structure classes and subclasses and how to build Jest testing files to verify that my classes and methods are running appropriately
